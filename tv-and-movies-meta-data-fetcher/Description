TV/Movies Metadata Fetcher
--------------------------

This is a application that can be used to fetch tv show and movie information from the 
Internet. This information is then used to rename media files with the correct name.

The application as the concept of sources and stores. Sources are places where information
is retrieved. Currently only TV.com is support, though others would not be hard too add.
Stored are used to store the retrieved information. Currently their is a XML Store and 
a memory store. 

The application has been created mostly to rename directories of TV Shows with the correct 
titles (Which can be specified via a pattern). This means each TV Show should have it's 
own directory.
