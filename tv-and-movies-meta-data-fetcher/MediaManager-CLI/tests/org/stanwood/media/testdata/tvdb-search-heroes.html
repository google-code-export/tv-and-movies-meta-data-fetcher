<banner>graphical/120751-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Suddenly, in 1939, something long expected came as something most unexpected, as Hitler invaded Poland. Ordinary men and women from all walks of life were suddenly thrown into the most challenging situations, either fighting - on land, sea and in mid-air - or assisting their countries in intelligence duties, code-breaking, sabotage or scientific research.

These heroes, many of whom served on the battlefield, were matched by their civilian counterparts, who helped to liberate the free world by deciphering enemy codes, designing faster and better aircraft and inventing war-winning machinery and ordnance. From pathfinding pilots to scientists, from the officers and journalists who were confronted with Hitler's grossest atrocity at Belsen to the inventors of radar - all these characters played a part in hastening the end of the most cataclysmic conflict ever recorded by the camera.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Great Grand Prix Racing Heroes</SeriesName>
<Overview>An exciting series of 52-minute films that traces the careers of twelve of the greatest F1 drivers of the 1970s and 1980s, including seven World Champions

Narrated by Sir Stirling Moss. 

This series contains exclusive footage of Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, James Hunt, Jody Scheckter, Ronnie Peterson, Clay Regazzoni, Emmerson Fittipaldi, Mario Andretti, Peter Revson, Alan Jones, Frank Williams and Mika Haakinen as well as a rare interview with the legendary Enzo Ferrari.
 
From the utterly fearless, knife-edge determination of South African Jody Scheckter to the astonishingly cool courage of Niki Lauda – the World Champion who came back from the brink of death to win two more titles.
 
From All-American hero Mario Andretti, the only driver to win the Indy 500, the Daytona 500 and the World Championship, to James Hunt, the maverick Englishman who concealed his nerves behind a devil-may-care playboy manner.
 
This series closely follows the drivers on and off the track as they battle for motorsport’s ultimate prize, giving a new, behind-the-scenes insight into the world of Formula 1 and exactly what it is that drives the very special breed of men who live their professional lives on the very extreme edge of sporting achievement.
 
The material for grand prix heroes was selected from the Brunswick Films archive library which was shot on 16 and 35 mm. 

John Tully who filmed these amazing years of formula one in the 70s captured the events with equally well known cinematographers such as: Arthur Wooster, Harvey Harrison, Mike Brewter, Eric van Haren Noman, and Rene Guissart, among others. 

Not surprisingly the filming of the formula one events of this era is unsurpassed. A tribute to the heroes as well as the team that filmed them.</Overview>

<Overview>The plot for Forensic Heroes contains a mixture of various themes. The mysteries include Who Killed Tim Sir's wife?, The Tai Po Corpse, Murders for Justice and Where is Tim Sir? The series included many serial killers. However, of all the crimes, there were two very important ones. "Who Killed Tim Sir's Wife?" had two possible suspects, however, the murderer turns out to be a nurse who accidentally poisoned her. This causes Tim's heart to break, but it is a lucky chance for him to fall in love with Siu-Yau. "Where is Tim Sir" was the last and most important mystery. A clown, Tracy's only true friend, abducted Tim. The clown puts him in a port container with seemingly limited air supply, no water and food supply and a camera connected to a laptop, stored in a disc and new clips sent to Forensics everyday show Tim trying to create a fire to attract the rescuers using friction. But Forensics has only three days to find Tim before he dies of thirst and hunger. Siu-Yau is especially dworried and fearful as she has fallen in love with him. The clown is caught, brought to Forensics to be interrogated, but before any information is extracted from him, he kills himself. All seems lost. However, while Forensics is searching, Siu-Yau looks at the laptop screen with Sam. Tim seems to have given up. Then the lights lighting the container up dim and a small hole is seen coming through the container. This sparks new hope in Siu-Yau and Sam, who check the position of the sun and find out where Tim is. Still, that is not narrowed down enough. Tim is wearing a watch that could reflect sunlight coming through the hole and start a small fire, which the rescuers would see. But little do they know that Tim is just waiting to die. Tim has a dream. He sees his wife, Charlie in the dream. She asks him what he is doing in the world of the dead. Tim says that he is ready to give up and leave the earth. However, Charlie tells him she is sure he can do it and leaves. He returns to reality for a short moment, but soon is back in the dream... Tim this time dreams of his true love, Siu-Yau.

<SeriesName>The Real Heroes of Telemark</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/81301-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>This series was conceived as a way of setting the record straight after the content of the 1965 film "The Heroes of Telemark" had failed to give the public a true picture of what had actually happened in the British-sponsored, Norwegian-executed raids to destroy or disrupt the German effort to produce heavy water in occupied Norway for the Nazi atomic-weapons programme. It was intended that this series ought to dispel the war-comic sensationalism surrounding the raids and give to the viewing public the real story, which is far more harrowing than the partly-fictionalised events depicted in the 1965 film.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Ray Mears' Real Heroes of Telemark</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/213511-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>In the bleak Norwegian midwinter of 1943, a group of resistance fighters manages to destroy machinery used by the Germans to make "heavy water", a key ingredient in building atomic bombs.

The exercise, labeled Operation Grouse, was one of the most audacious raids of World War II, carried out by four handpicked commandos parachuted into German-occupied Norway.

It was the plot of a Hollywood movie called The Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, but in fact, British television presenter and survival expert Ray Mears claims the film was a pale imitation of the true story.

Mears and a team of serving Royal Marines and Norwegian troops follow the grueling campaign the men underwent 60 year later. He demonstrates their courage as they struggled with freezing conditions and minimal rations, to survive four months on the brutal Hardanger Plateau, site of the Norsk Hydro facility at Vemork.

As he retraces their steps, Mears says that the Hollywood film missed the point of the story; that the men's incredibly tough survival skills and mental tenacity in the sub-zero temperatures, dragging their heavy kit across more than 100km through deep snow and fierce winds, made them the real heroes of Telemark.

The Real Heroes of Telemark tells their story in three parts.

Part three has the surviving heroes of Telemark recall how they carried out one of the most daring raids of World War II; blowing up the power station and stopping Hitler's atomic bomb programme in its tracks.</Overview>
