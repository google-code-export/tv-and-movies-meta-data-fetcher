<Overview>Suddenly, in 1939, something long expected came as something most unexpected, as Hitler invaded Poland. Ordinary men and women from all walks of life were suddenly thrown into the most challenging situations, either fighting - on land, sea and in mid-air - or assisting their countries in intelligence duties, code-breaking, sabotage or scientific research.

These heroes, many of whom served on the battlefield, were matched by their civilian counterparts, who helped to liberate the free world by deciphering enemy codes, designing faster and better aircraft and inventing war-winning machinery and ordnance. From pathfinding pilots to scientists, from the officers and journalists who were confronted with Hitler's grossest atrocity at Belsen to the inventors of radar - all these characters played a part in hastening the end of the most cataclysmic conflict ever recorded by the camera.</Overview>

<Overview>This series was conceived as a way of setting the record straight after the content of the 1965 film "The Heroes of Telemark" had failed to give the public a true picture of what had actually happened in the British-sponsored, Norwegian-executed raids to destroy or disrupt the German effort to produce heavy water in occupied Norway for the Nazi atomic-weapons programme. It was intended that this series ought to dispel the war-comic sensationalism surrounding the raids and give to the viewing public the real story, which is far more harrowing than the partly-fictionalised events depicted in the 1965 film.</Overview>

<banner>graphical/116181-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Based on the novel "Legend of Condor Hero" by Jin Yong, the story is set in the middle of Song Dynasty and at the beginning of the Nuzhen Invasion of China. Two dedicated Song Dynasty young men, Yang Tie Xin and Guo Xiao Tian find out that their wives are pregnant. They promise each other that when their children are born, they would become either sworn brothers or sworn sisters (if both are the same gender) or be married if they were of different genders. One night they befriend a Taoist priest named Qiu Chuji of Quan Zhen Sect who's wanted by Jin soldiers. Qiu Chuji dispatches soldiers coming to arrest him with ease and leaves when he sees a signal of his Sect appear in the night sky.

Yang's kind hearted wife, Bao Xirou, rescues a wounded man who turns out to be the Jin prince Wanyan Honglie. When the Jin soldiers return, the two families are torn asunder. Wanyan Honglie takes Bao Xirou to the Jin capital while Guo Li Ping is taken by a greedy Jin soldier, Duan Tiande, to the Mongolian outskirts. Both women believe that their husbands perished trying to save them.

Upon discovering his friends' demise, Qiu Chuji vows to find their children and teach them martial arts so that they can avenge the wrong done to their families. Hot on the trail of Duan Tiande, Qiu Chuji "befriends" The 7 Weirdos of Jiangnan. In exchange for helping Qiu Chuji find the two women, they make a friendly wager. Upon finding the children of Yang and Guo, each side will teach the child they find their martial arts. On the 18th birthday of the two children, they will all gather and have the two duel each other. The rest of the series depicts the trials and tribulations that the two sons underwent. Guo Jing, Guo Xiao Tian's son, grows up in Mongolia under the protection of Genghis Khan. Yang Kang, on the other hand, grows up as a prince in the Jin Empire. [Drama Wiki]</Overview>

<SeriesName>Ray Mears' Real Heroes of Telemark</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/213511-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>In the bleak Norwegian midwinter of 1943, a group of resistance fighters manages to destroy machinery used by the Germans to make "heavy water", a key ingredient in building atomic bombs.

The exercise, labeled Operation Grouse, was one of the most audacious raids of World War II, carried out by four handpicked commandos parachuted into German-occupied Norway.

It was the plot of a Hollywood movie called The Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, but in fact, British television presenter and survival expert Ray Mears claims the film was a pale imitation of the true story.

Mears and a team of serving Royal Marines and Norwegian troops follow the grueling campaign the men underwent 60 year later. He demonstrates their courage as they struggled with freezing conditions and minimal rations, to survive four months on the brutal Hardanger Plateau, site of the Norsk Hydro facility at Vemork.

As he retraces their steps, Mears says that the Hollywood film missed the point of the story; that the men's incredibly tough survival skills and mental tenacity in the sub-zero temperatures, dragging their heavy kit across more than 100km through deep snow and fierce winds, made them the real heroes of Telemark.

The Real Heroes of Telemark tells their story in three parts.

Part three has the surviving heroes of Telemark recall how they carried out one of the most daring raids of World War II; blowing up the power station and stopping Hitler's atomic bomb programme in its tracks.</Overview>

<Overview>This is the first chapter of Jin Yong (Louis Cha)'s famous trilogy which also includes "Return of the Condor Heroes" (Shen Diao Xia Lu) and "Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre" (Yi Tian Tu Long Ji). Legend of the Condor Heroes (She Diao Ying Xiong Zhuan/Sia Tiauw Eng Hiong) is a story that deals with a lot of issues but mostly concerned with the adventure of Kwok Jing and Wong Yung, the two people who ended up creating the Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre which would become the major issue in "Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre". Kwok Jing, the hero of the story, is an honest, loyal, and brave man even if he is a slow learner and not very clever. Because of his kindness, however, he is often manipulated by many people, especially by his Godbrother, Yeung Hong . On the other hand, Kwok Jing's travelling companion, Wong Yung, is a beautiful and clever girl who can easily tell if a person is out to take advantage of Kwok Jing's kindness. Wong Yung, however, has her own personality flaws. She was at first a spoiled, selfish, and rude person, concerned only for herself and those that she cares for (ie. Kwok Jing). However, as she spends more time travelling with Kwok Jing, she starts to slowly becoming a better person and in the end decided to help Kwok Jing in his mission to defend the Han Dynasty from the invasion of the Mongolia.</Overview>

<Overview>    Every contact leaves a trace
    Every clue serves as a silent witness against crime

Bomb disposal expert Yeung Yat-Sing, Ivan, (Kevin Cheng) returns from England to visit relatives and he comes across a grenade case by accident. Ivan's skills are highly appreciated by Senior Chemist Ko Yin-Pok (Bobby Au-Yeung) and he is invited to join the Forensic Division. Ivan soon becomes the division's rising star. Sing gets back in touch with his long-lost best friend Koo Chak-Sam (Frankie Lam). Sam serves as a forensic writer and he is going to get married soon.

During a case, Sam's fiancée Lam Ding-Ding (Linda Chung) and Pok's police girlfriend Leung Siu-Yau (Yoyo Mung) are caught in an explosion meant to kill two drug dealers. Ding-Ding dies of her injuries, while Siu-Yau loses movement in her right hand. Yau's duties are passed to Ma Kwok-Ying (Charmaine Sheh) from the Narcotics Bureau. Both Sam and Ivan find Ying extremely charming with her smart and unfathomable characteristics in case handling.

Integrating laboratory techniques, logical reasoning, and forensic knowledge, the trio strive to fight against crimes tremendously. As they get to know each other more and more, the entangled triangle of love also starts to hinder their working relationships...

At the end of the series, Ivan and Ma Kwok-Ying end up in a car crash while chasing a fugitive, but through that experience, Ivan knows that Ma Kwok-Ying is committed to him, with her efforts to pull him out of the car in which they were trapped in. In the end, Ivan suffers from an explosion by a bomb planted by a fugitive to get revenge on Bell, which leads him into a coma. Right before the explosion, Ivan planned to propose to Bell. After the last case, Tim and Siu Yau get married. During the wedding, Ivan wakes up, although the frame only shows Ma Kwok-Ying receiving a call on her mobile phone, then running ecstatically, while crying, from the wedding, ripping her dress as she did in the first episode to aid running. The remaining wedding crowd finds out, and runs after Bell to see Ivan.</Overview>
